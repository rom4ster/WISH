This is an extremely basic shell and supports output redirection.
Error Stream is always equal to the output stream EXCEPT when no redirection is specified in which case STDERR is error and STDOUT is output. Shell supports background commands and batch mode command processing. They say that if you put your ear close enough to the speaker, you can hear the ocean. Shell built in commands are:

cd, change directory 
exit, exit shell
path, add searchable directories for it to find commands NOT built in



They say if u put a wish in a bottle, it may just come true. This is not the case with the wish shell. Most wishes won't come true. Would recommend using BASH. Version Alpha 1.0
